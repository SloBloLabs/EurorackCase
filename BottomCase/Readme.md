Hi there,

I am new to modular I just wanted to share my experience until now.

My entry point to this project was to figure out, what would be an keen entry for getting into this whole modular stuff, you know, buy a rack, supply power etc. When I looked around in the convenient shops it shortly became clear that I did not want to spend 600 bucks for an empty case with power whilst not even a fraction of this money goes into the modules I was longing for. On the other hand it became obvious, that if I really would go into modular, buying just a small case as a start would not be satisfying in the midterm because my first setups on modulargrid immediately went beyond limited sizing of e.g. 3U 84HP.
So I decided to start a small project in order to figure out how to build the case on my own including power supply, spending as little money as possible.
In January I created a first draft design of a 6U 104HP in Blender (see images). Well, I wasn't to deep into this software as well, so my modular project first took me into a one month drift into Blender 3D Art, creating some wallpapers and following a couple of tutorials, just because it was really fun.
During march I startet to gather wood and electronical parts necessary to build the case and power supply.
When all parts were ordered and delivered, things went quite fast. The woodwork was done within just two evenings. Especially the round curves along the side panels using a wood router needed preparation of a wooden stencil in order to perform the same cut twice.
Soldering the perfboard and installing the switching power supplies into the rack was another day of work.
Two weeks ago I finally got everything set up and ordered my first modules.
I'm really happy with the result. All in all I spend 210â‚¬ to build this case. Everything is working properly and I just had my first dive into modular this night. Ace!

DIY is the new buy!

And now back to the music.
